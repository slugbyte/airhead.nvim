# CONTRIBUTING? Thanks for the help <3
I love to enable people to contribute, and welcome suggestions and PRs! I do however have
strong preferences for the aesthetics of lackluster and I reserve the right to modify or 
reject any contributions as I see fit.

## LACKLUSTER GOALS
> These goals should be kept in mind when making a contribution :)
* Maximize code readability and minimize visual noise
* Make it easy to quickly visually identify...
  * Function and type definitions
  * Function return and exception points
  * Function calls
  * Builtin modules and functions
  * Diagnostic errors
* Support commonly used neovim plugins
* Be easy on the eyes

## Bugs 
If you find a bug please open a ticket :) If the issue is color related, please include a
screenshot.

## Spellcheck
I'm super dyslexic, and do my best with spellcheck, but that only works so well. So if 
you find a spelling error free to open a PR :)

## Suggestions, Feature Request, General Input
If you have some input or a feature request, please open a discussion issue before opening a PR.
I'm open to new Ideas I just want chat about them first.

## Adding Plugin Support
If you want to add support for a plugin open a ticket with the `enhancement` label to let
myself and potentially others know what you are working on. We can also use that as a discussion
thread for what colors best suite the lackluster aesthetic.

When you open a PR with your plugin implementation please include some screenshots and an example
configuration for the plugin you implemented. I will test your PR and potentially make some changes 
to your color choices before I merge.

Your the best! Thanks so much for contributing!

## TODO / GREAT FIRST ISSUE
I plan on slowly adding support for the following tools, and would love help if anyone is
interested in contributing :)

I don't use these plugins so I makes it quite a bit of work to implement my self, so this
will probably be a slow long term effort.
