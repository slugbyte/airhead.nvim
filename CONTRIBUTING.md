# CONTRIBUTING? Thanks for the help <3

## Bugs and Spellcheck
If you find a spelling error in the readme feel free to open a PR :)

If you find a bug please open a ticket :) if the issue is color related, please include a
screenshot

## Adding Plugin Support
If you want to add support for a plugin open a PR with your suggested colors and include 
some screenshots! I reserve the right to change or reject any PRs as I see fit, but If
It seems to follow the rest of the `lackluster` vibe, I would love love to merge your
work!

## Suggestions, Feature Request, General Input
If you have some other input, please open a discussion issue before opening a PR.
I'm open to new Ideas just want chat about them first.
